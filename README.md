Hello, my name is Evandro.

I am passionate about technology and the benefits it brings to society.

I am currently studying the Python programming language. I like learning about new technologies and using them to apply solutions. I like organization and I am very detail-oriented and I believe that this has a strong connection with data analysis. You need to be sensitive to the smallest details that the data offers, as these will become powerful information.
